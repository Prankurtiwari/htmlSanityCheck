[.lead]
====
This project provides some basic sanity checking on html files.

It can be helpful in case of html generated from, e.g., {asciidoc-url}[Asciidoctor],
Markdown or other formats -- as converters usually don't check for missing images
or broken links.
====

It can be currently used

* Programmatically from Java (or other JVM languages), or
* As a xref:{xrefToGradlePlugin}[Gradle plugin].

Standalone Java (CLI) executable and a https://maven.apache.org[Apache Maven] Plugin are planned for future releases.

== Installation

Use the following snippet inside a Gradle build file:

.build.gradle
[source,groovy,subs="attributes+"]
----
plugins {
    id 'org.aim42.{project}' version '{version}' // <1>
}
----
<1> Checkout <<box:current-version,current version>>

OR

.build.gradle
[source,groovy,subs="attributes+"]
----
buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }

    dependencies {
        classpath ('gradle.plugin.org.aim42:{project}:{version}') // <1>
    }
}

apply plugin: 'org.aim42.{project}'
----
<1> Checkout <<box:current-version,current version>>

[[box:current-version]]
[IMPORTANT]
.Latest (development) version
====
The current development version is defined in link:gradle.properties[]

[source]
----
include::gradle.properties[tag=version]
----
====

== Usage

The plugin adds a new task named `htmlSanityCheck`.

This task exposes a few properties as part of its configuration:

[horizontal]
sourceDir:: (mandatory) directory where the html files are located.
Type: File.
Default: `build/docs`.
sourceDocuments:: (optional) an override to process several source files, which may be a subset of all files available in `+{sourceDir}+`.
Type: `org.gradle.api.file.FileCollection`.
Defaults to all files in `+{sourceDir}+` whose names end with `.html`.

checkingResultsDir:: (optional) directory where the checking results written to.
Defaults to `+{buildDir}+/reports/htmlSanityCheck/`

junitResultsDir:: (optional) directory where the results are written to in JUnit XML format.
JUnit XML can be read by many tools, including CI environments.
Defaults to `+{buildDir}+/test-results/htmlchecks/`

failOnErrors:: (optional) if set to "true", the build will fail if any error was found in the checked pages.
Defaults to `false`

checkerClasses:: (optional) a set of checker classes to be executed.
Defaults to all available checker classes.

== Examples

.build.gradle (small example)
[source,groovy]
----
apply plugin: 'org.aim42.htmlSanityCheck'

htmlSanityCheck {
    sourceDir = new File( "$buildDir/docs" )

    // where to put results of sanityChecks...
    checkingResultsDir = new File( "$buildDir/report/htmlchecks" )

    // fail build on errors?
    failOnErrors = true

}

.build.gradle (extensive example)
[source,groovy,subs='attributes']
----

import org.aim42.htmlsanitycheck.check.*

buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
        // This is only necessary for older releases (< 2.00)
        gradlePluginPortal()
    }
}

plugins {
    id 'org.aim42.htmlsanitycheck' version '{version}'
    id 'org.asciidoctor.convert' version '1.5.8'

// ==== path definitions =====

    // which statuscodes shall be interpreted as warning, error or success
    // defaults to standard
    httpWarningCodes = [401]
    // httpErrorCodes
    // httpSuccessCodes

    // only execute a subset of all available checks
    // available checker:

    //   * BrokenHttpLinksChecker
    //   * DuplicateIdChecker
    //   * ImageMapChecker

    //   * MissingImageFilesChecker
    //   * MissingLocalResourcesChecker

== Typical Output

[cols="1,1",width="50%"]
|===
| The overall goal is to create neat and clear reports,
showing eventual errors within HTML files - as shown in the adjoining figure.

== Types of Sanity Checks

=== Broken Cross References (aka Broken Internal Links)

Finds all '<a href="XYZ">' where XYZ is not defined.

.src/broken.html
[source,html]
----
<a href="#missing">internal anchor</a>
...
<h2 id="missinG">Bookmark-Header</h2>
----

In this example, the bookmark is _misspelled_.

Use checkerClass _BrokenCrossReferencesChecker_.

=== Missing Images Files

Images, referenced in `<img src="XYZ"...` tags, refer to external files.
The plugin checks the existence of these files.

Use checkerClass _MissingImageFilesChecker_.

=== Multiple Definitions of Bookmarks or ID's

If any is defined more than once, any anchor linking to it will be confused.

Use checkerClass _DuplicateIdChecker_.

=== Missing Local Resources

All files, (e.g., downloads) referenced from html.

Use checkerClass _MissingLocalResourcesChecker_.

=== Missing Alt-tags in Images

Image-tags should contain an alt-attribute that the browser displays when the original image file cannot be found or cannot be rendered.
Having alt-attributes is a good and defensive style.

Use checkerClass _MissingAltInImageTagsChecker_.

=== Broken HTTP Links

The current version (derived from branch 1.0.0-RC-2) contains a simple implementation that identifies errors (status >400) and warnings (status `1xx` or `3xx`).

StatusCodes are configurable ranges (as some people might want some content behind paywalls NOT to result in errors...)

Localhost or numerical IP addresses are currently NOT marked as suspicious.

Please comment in case you have additional requirements.

Use checkerClass _BrokenHttpLinksChecker_.

=== Other types of external links

*planned*: ftp, ntp or other protocols are currently not checked, but should...

== Technical Documentation

In addition to checking HTML, this project serves as an example for https://arc42.de[arc42].

Please see our https://aim42.github.io/htmlSanityCheck/arc42/About-This-Docu.html[software architecture documentation].

== Fundamentals

This tiny piece rests on incredible groundwork:

* https://jsoup.org[Jsoup HTML parser] and analysis toolkit - robust and easy-to-use.

* IntelliJ IDEA - my (Gernot) best (programming) friend.

* Of course, Groovy, Gradle, JUnit and Spock framework.

== Ideas and Origin

* The plugin heavily relies on code provided by {gradle-url}[Gradle].

* Inspiration on code organization, implementation and testing of the plugin came from the {asciidoctor-gradle-plugin-url}[Asciidoctor-Gradle-Plugin] by [@AAlmiray].

* Code for string similarity calculation by
https://github.com/rrice/java-string-similarity[Ralph Rice].

* Implementation, maintenance and documentation by
* Current implementation, main
** Initially: {gernotstarke}[Gernot Starke],
** Currently: {gerdaschemann}[Gerd Aschemann] and several other contributors.

== Development

In case you want to check out, fork and/or contribute:
The documentation is maintained using the awesome
https://github.com/docToolchain/docToolchain[docToolchain], created by https://rdmueller.github.io/[@rdmueller].

The complete documentation can be build and checked

[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]

----
<1> This does currently only work with a JDK 8.x (at least on MacOS)
<2> The docToolchain `htmlSanityCheck` task uses a released version of HSC (not the current development version) by default.

=== Helpful Sources for Development

Several sources provided help during development:

* Gradle guide on https://www.gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/custom_plugins.html[writing custom plugins]
* Of course, the https://jsoup.org/apidocs/[JSoup API documentation]

== Similar Projects

* The https://github.com/rackerlabs/gradle-linkchecker-plugin[gradle-linkchecker-plugin] is an (open source) Gradle plugin which validates that all links in a local HTML file tree go out to other existing local files or remote web locations.
It creates a simple text file report and might be a complement to this `HtmlSanityChecker`.
* https://bmuschko.com/blog/golang-with-gradle/[Benjamin Muschko] has created a (Go-based) command-line tool to check links, called https://github.com/bmuschko/link-verifier[link verifier].
* https://github.com/gjtorikian/html-proofer[html-proofer] is written in Ruby and provides different usage scenarios (programmatically, CLI, and Docker).
* https://github.com/wjdp/htmltest[htmltest] is also written in Go(Lang) and claims to be rapid compared to `html-proofer` (stay tuned; we have plans for HSC to run with Graal in a quick way).

== Contributing

Please report {plugin-issues}[issues or suggestions].

Want to improve the plugin: Fork our {plugin-url}[repository] and send a pull request.

== Licence

Currently, code is published under the Apache-2.0 licence, documentation under Creative-Commons-Sharealike-4.0.
Some day we'll unify that :-)
