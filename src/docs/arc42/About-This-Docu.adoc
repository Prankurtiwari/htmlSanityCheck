== Goals of this Documentation

:filename: arc42/About-This-Docu.adoc

This documentation is an example of
{arc42-url}[arc42] documentation.

You may copy this documentation or parts of it for your own
projects. In such cases you must include a link or
reference to {arc42-url}[arc42] or {aim42-url}[aim42]
(we regard this as _fair-use_).

For real-world projects,
the relation of code and documentation is over-sized.
