== {issue-open} Automated Checker Factory (185)

https://github.com/aim42/htmlSanityCheck/issues/185[Issue 185]
proposes to automatically detect and instantiate Checker
(sub-) classes.

=== Problem

We want to adhere to the Open-Close principle (OCP)
when adding new checkers:

There shall be no need to touch other code when
writing a new checker, especially should there be
no central _registry_ of checkers.

Up to v 1.0.0-RC-1 we violated the OCP and allowed
major redundancies in the code:

[source,java]
----
class AllCheckers {

    public final static Set<Class> checkerClazzes =
            [BrokenCrossReferencesChecker,
             BrokenHttpLinksChecker,
             DuplicateIdChecker,
             ImageMapChecker,
             MissingAltInImageTagsChecker,
             MissingImageFilesChecker,
             MissingLocalResourcesChecker].toSet()
}
----


=== Solution Approach

A solution needs to address two issues:

. _find_ all Checker subclasses, e.g., by https://www.baeldung.com/java-scan-annotations-runtime[Java Annotations].
. _instantiate_ these classes (aka _Factory_ for the checkers)
