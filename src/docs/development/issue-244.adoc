== Handling 30x Status Codes


https://github.com/aim42/htmlSanityCheck/issues/244[Issue 244]
explains that status codes 30x (redirect of some kind)
might signal an error, but can return the new location
of the requested resource.

For example: (`curl -I performs a HEAD request)

....
<snip>

curl -I http://www.arc.de

HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
Connection: keep-alive
Keep-Alive: timeout=15
Date: Wed, 24 Oct 2018 14:16:04 GMT
Server: Apache
X-Powered-By: PHP/7.0.32
Location: https://arc42.de/
</snip>

....

So - the url exists in principle (in the example above,
it only changed from `http` to `https`...


=== Proposed Approach

A very simple solution would be to
access the location header and return
that together with the warning message.

if (responseCode in [301, 302, 303, 307, 308]) then {
    // get location
    String newLocation
    if (connection.headerFields.'Location') {
         // add connection.headerFields.Location.first() to warning message
    }
}
