== Prerequisites

=== General Prerequisites

Make yourself familiar with

* The https://gradle.org[Gradle] build system,
* https://jsoup.org/apidocs/[JSoup API documentation].

=== Prerequisites for Gradle Plugin Development

You should definitely read the original https://www.gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/custom_plugins.html[Gradle Plugin Development Guide] on custom plugin development.


== Adding New Checks
To add new checks, you have to subclass from 'org.aim42.htmlsanitycheck.check.Checker'
and implement the 'performCheck' method - which requires an 'HtmlPage' instance as parameter.

Don't forget to:
* write a test or spec for your checker - the code in 'test/groovy/org.aim42.htmlsanitycheck.check'
gives many examples
* add your checker class to the 'public static AllCheckers' list (Set, to be precise)
of available checkers. This set is used to configure the 'AllChecksRunner' class.

== Directory Structure and Required Files

=== Core Module

TBD

=== Gradle Plugin

<1> the actual plugin code, a xyzPlugin and xyzTask groovy files
<2> Gradle expects plugin properties in META-INF
<3> Property file containing the name of the actual implementation class:

 implementation-class=org.aim42.htmlsanitycheck.HtmlSanityCheckPlugin

=== Notes for IntelliJ Users
If you work with IntelliJ, you should configure your run- and test configurations
so that the working-directory is set to your current module - most easily done
by making $MODULE_DIR$ your default.
